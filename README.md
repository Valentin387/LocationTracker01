# Real-Time Location Manager (Kotlin)

This Kotlin application manages the user's location in real-time using a foreground service. The project is based on a 2023 tutorial by Phillip Lackner, with updates to ensure compatibility as of August 2024.

## Overview

The app tracks and manages location updates in real-time while running as a foreground service. It demonstrates a clean and efficient approach to handling location services in Android, making use of modern Kotlin features such as flows for asynchronous data streams.

## Technical Information

### Manifest Declarations

- **Services:** The app runs location management as a foreground service.
- **Permissions:** Necessary permissions for location access and background service are declared.
- **Application:** The app requires a custom `Application` class to create notification channels for the foreground service.

### Location Client Abstraction

The `LocationClient` interface provides an abstraction for location services:

```kotlin
interface LocationClient {
    fun getLocationUpdates(interval: Long): Flow<Location>

    class LocationException(message: String): Exception()
}
```

- **Location Updates:** The `getLocationUpdates` method returns a flow that emits new location data at a specified interval.
- **Exception Handling:** The `LocationException` class is used to handle errors in location services.

This abstraction simplifies integration into view models, avoiding the need to directly handle context-sensitive implementations in UI layers.

### Foreground Service

The application includes a foreground service to ensure continuous location tracking even when the app is in the background. The service operates with a notification channel to keep the user informed of ongoing location tracking.

### Permissions

While the sample assumes all permissions are granted, fine-grained permission handling should be implemented in a production environment.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up:**
   - Install Android Studio.
   - Connect a real Android device via USB (emulators may have issues with location services).
  
2. **Run the Application:**
   - Install the app on your device using Android Studio.
   - The app has two buttons: **Start** and **Stop**.
   - Press **Start** to begin location tracking. The service will run in the foreground, even when switching to other apps.
  
3. **Location Data:**
   - The app provides location updates in terms of latitude and longitude.

## Sidenotes

### 1. **Foreground Services**

If you want your app to perform tasks while it’s not in the foreground, a common approach is to use a **Foreground Service**. Foreground services are designed to keep your app running and notify users that the app is doing something important.

### 2. **Background Tasks**

For tasks that don’t need to keep the app running but require background processing, you can use:

This should provide users with a clear understanding of the project while also giving them insights into foreground services and background tasks.
